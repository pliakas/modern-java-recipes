# Lab 2: Week Two - Introduction to functional Interfaces
You need to work on maven module `Week-two-functional-interfaces`.

## Description
The java.util.Function package presents the new `java.util.function` package, which was added to the language in Java 8. 
The interfaces in the package fall into four special categories (consumers, suppliers, predicates and functions) that 
are used throughout the rest of the standard library.The `java.util.Function` package presents 
the new `java.util.function` package, which was added to the language since Java 8. The interfaces in the package fall 
into four special categories (consumers, suppliers, predicates and functions) that are used throughout the rest of the 
standard library.


## Exercise One : The `java.util.function.Predicate` functional interface
In java class `edu.aegean.epta.java.recipes.week.two.PredicatesExercises` you need to implement all methods, to pass the
unittests. You can verify that your solution works by executing the unittests in java class 
`edu.aegean.epta.java.recipes.week.two.PredicatesExercisesTest`. **Do not edit the unittests**. 

## Exercise Two : The `java.util.function.Function` functional interface
In java class `edu.aegean.epta.java.recipes.week.two.FunctionalExercices` you need to implement all methods, to pass the
unittests. You can verify that your solution works by executing the unittests in java class
`edu.aegean.epta.java.recipes.week.two.FunctionalExercicesTest`. **Do not edit the unittests**.

## Exercise Three : The `java.util.function.Consumer` functional interface
In java class `edu.aegean.epta.java.recipes.week.two.ConsumerExercises` you need to implement all methods, to pass the
unittests. You can verify that your solution works by executing the unittests in java class
`edu.aegean.epta.java.recipes.week.two.ConsumerExercisesTest`. **Do not edit the unittests**.

## Exercise Four : The `java.util.function.Supplier` functional interface
In java class `edu.aegean.epta.java.recipes.week.two.SupplierExercises` you need to implement all methods, to pass the
unittests. You can verify that your solution works by executing the unittests in java class
`edu.aegean.epta.java.recipes.week.two.SupplierExercisesTest`. **Do not edit the unittests**.

## Exercise Five : Default Methods and Iterating over a collection
In java class `edu.aegean.epta.java.recipes.week.two.DefaultMethodsExercises` you need to implement all methods, to pass the
unittests. You can verify that your solution works by executing the unittests in java class
`edu.aegean.epta.java.recipes.week.two.DefaultMethodsExercisesTest`. **Do not edit the unittests**.
